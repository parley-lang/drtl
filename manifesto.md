# The Manifesto

> A declaration for DRTL &mdash; Declarative Reasoning Topology Language

## 1. AI systems don't need to be caged.
AI can explore, reason, and act.<br/>
From the routine to the complex, at a scale no human can sustain.<br/>
The capability is real and it is expanding.<br/>
The right response to that power is not to clip its wings.<br/>
Blanket restriction doesn't make a system safer. It makes it smaller.

## 2. AI systems must be intentional.
You decide what the system should be before it starts acting.<br/>
Strict or loose, verified or trusted, autonomous or human-gated &mdash; all valid.<br/>
What is not valid is undeclared.

## 3. The topology is the contract.
A topology is a formal declaration of what the reasoning pipeline is &mdash; what executes, how it connects, what gets verified, who must approve.<br/>
Not a prompt.<br/>
Not a system instruction that might be followed.<br/>
A contract.

## 4. The runtime keeps the promise.
It does not decide.<br/>
It does not improvise.<br/>
It executes the topology faithfully, produces a trace of everything that happened, and refuses to proceed when obligations are unmet.<br/>
It keeps the promise.
